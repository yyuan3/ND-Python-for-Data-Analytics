    "### Dynamic vs. Static Typing\n",
    "One of the major reasons that Python has become so widely used is that it is very approachable for beginners. Part of this approachability comes from it being what is called a *dynamically typed* language.\n",
    "\n",
    "While a statically-typed language (the opposite of Python) like C or Java requires the type (or class) of each variable to be explicitly declared, a dynamically-typed language like Python skips this specification. For example, in C you might specify a simple loop operation as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C\n",
    "/* C code */\n",
    "int result = 0;\n",
    "for(int i=0; i<100; i++){\n",
    "    result += i;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "The two `int` strings that appear before `result = 0` and `i=0` are ***type declarations***.  It limits what types of data can be stored in those variable names.\n",
    "</div> \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the equivalent operation could be written this way:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Python code\n",
    "result = 0\n",
    "for i in range(100):\n",
    "    result += i\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the main difference: in C, the data types of each variable are explicitly declared, while in Python the types are dynamically inferred. This means, for example, that we can assign any kind of data to any variable **and** we can change the data types of an existing variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Python code\n",
    "x = 42\n",
    "x = \"fortytwo\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we've switched the contents of ``x`` from an integer (number) to a string. The same thing in a statically typed language would lead to a compilation error or other unintented consequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C\n",
    "/* C code */\n",
    "int x = 42;\n",
    "x = \"fortytwo\";  // FAILS\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Being able to skip type declarations like this removes a lot of boilerplate (repetitive) code from your programs - which speeds up program development.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are however, a couple of tradeoffs with dynamic typing. One of the is that under the covers, a given Python variable stores not only it's value, but also it's current type, which takes up a small amount of additional memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to this, various operations often have to inspect objects and determine their type/class before performing their work. This inspection takes time, and therefore an equivalent program in a dynamically typed language can be expected to run slower than one in a statically typed language.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a tradeoff between development speed vs. execution speed."
